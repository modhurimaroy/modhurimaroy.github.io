Congrats on making it to my about page! You must be really curious, or just really lost. Either way, welcome!

I am Modhurima Roy - a computer engineer currently working as Software Analyst at Hitachi Rail. I recently graduated from the University of Toronto in Computer Engineering, with a focus on Software Engineering and Networks, and a minor in Artificial Intelligence and certificate in Engineering Business. My academic journey has been a blend of rigorous technical training and an exploration of AI's potential to transform industries, which has fueled my passion for innovation and problem-solving. 

#### A little bit of background
I was born and brought up in Bangladesh, the beautiful country of six seasons, huge rivers and vibrant culture, where we speak the sweetest language in the world - Bengali. I come from the city of Sylhet - the land of 360 saints and Sufi shrines, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Hasan Raja, Baul Shah Abdul Karim and Radharomon Dutta, and is situated near the bank of the river Surma in north-eastern Bangladesh. 

#### Who I really am...
Beyond my engineering pursuits, I am also an avid music enthusiast and singer and I post covers of my favourite songs on my YouTube channel. I grew up listening to the music of great artists across Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent, as I developed a deep appreciation of good music. From Rabindrashangeet to Ghazals I have always tried my best to unfold the meaning of the lyrics and connect to the tune and to pick up the best of all worlds to learn and incorporate in my own singing. 

#### There's more
When I’m not immersed in code or researching the latest tech trends, you can find me enjoying a good cup of coffee in a nearby cafe, reading books and planning my next travel adventure. I’m deeply interested in exploring the mysteries of the universe and existentialism — topics I love to discuss with like-minded souls. If you're eager to chat about the cosmos, stoicism, or the deeper questions of life, I’d love to connect and explore these ideas together.
