Human civilization has witnessed the most unsolvable mysteries unravel in front of their eyes. Yet, millions of other mysteries still remain unsolved, mostly involving the universe in which we reside. Of all the cosmological enigmas that have left humans confused, blackhole is the most significant question mark in astronomy.  In this article, I’d like to take a dive into the basics of what makes a black hole so interesting and why it is the greatest mystery of all time. 

### What is a black hole?

Great scientists like Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking have spent their entire lifetime carrying out research on the whats and hows of black holes. Okay, but what exactly is a black hole?

A black hole is a spherical region in space, bounded by a horizon, within which the gravitational pull is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape it. The boundary surrounding the black hole called the ‘event horizon’, is not a physical surface but rather ‘the point of no return’ where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. 

Once the matter is past the event horizon it gravitates to the center, the point of infinite density and a volume so tiny it is considered zero. This center point of a black hole is called a singularity, where the laws of physics disintegrate and make it impossible to predict what exactly goes on inside a black hole. As long as we don’t have a theory that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, we cannot explain what happens inside a black hole. 

### Failure of the Theory of General Relativity

Gravity emerges from the interaction of space and time. The theory of relativity has so far helped us understand the behaviour of a black hole. However, the black hole itself limits the theory of relativity at the quantum level.
