2024 so far has been a year of major transitions and I can confirm that no matter how well you prepare or how much your overthink your major life changes, you cannot escape the anxiety, or worse, the feeling of existentialism. 

I was expecting that graduation would perhaps being me a sense of accomplishment, or maybe getting a job offer would bring me the satisfaction that I am indeed a skilled human being capable of creating value. The relief of securing a job in this challenging economy was quickly overshadowed by the realization that it’s just one step towards the bigger goal, not the end goal, and that there is more to life than being a labor in the workforce with skills and capabilities to slave away. Many people, including me, had the expectation that after graduating and securing a job, I should feel happy and fulfilled. But when that feeling did not immediately materialize, it led me to question about what actually brings fulfillment in my life.

The academia has given my life a clear structure for as long as I can remember, probably since kindergarten. There were specific goals to achieve, and only one job to be best at: learning effectively. Best of them all, academia gave me the defined identity as a student, and there was an inherent sense of progress, no matter how difficult the challenges were. As soon as I graduated, that structure disappeared in the blink of an eye and the gaping void stared dead at me, although I foresaw that moment many months ago. Expectations were higher, responsibilities heavier and margin of error thinner than ever before. I saw all of these coming my way, but there was just one blow I missed, which hit me really hard afterwards. 

It was the stark reminder that time is passing by, making me more aware of my mortality and the limited nature of my time here. I used to think people only discussed about existentialism to sound cool and intellectual (trust me, I have been with people who did so) and I barely spent any time  thinking about my existence. Honestly, mortality was not something that bothered me. 

But there was a significant change in my thought processes recently, and I realized that the topic of mortality does make me a little uncomfortable, and scared. I have a hard time (still) accepting the fact that there is nothing, literally nothing, after we die. All that we know, all that we feel and smell and hear and say, will be gone with our consciousness perishing, along with our human body.  This makes me want to live more, sing more, laugh more and love more often. Because the world itself is neutral, and it’s we who choose to give meaning to the experiences we go through, which is good news since it’s upon us to define our purpose, to shape our paths and to assign significance to the things we resonate with. Each choice, each moment of connection and each step forward are all pieces of the puzzle we tend to solve throughout our lives. 

After months of introspection I have come to realize that it’s not about finding a singular answer, but about continuously building a narrative that is meaningful to us. And maybe, just maybe, the journey of life itself is the meaning we've been searching for all along.
